- **User Authentication**: Sign up, sign in, and sign out functionality using Firebase.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI that works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Toast Notifications**: Real-time feedback for user actions (e.g., sign-up success, errors).
- **Modals**: User-friendly modal dialogs for sign-up and sign-in processes.

## Technologies Used
